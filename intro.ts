// what does typescript does :

// static checking it analyses the code and help you to understand it might be running into a potential error without even running the code and getting the rrors 

// ts is a development too , that means your projects still runs in js 

// when ts code is run the code converts to js 
// it  is a super set of js 
// to install typescript : npm install -g typescript 
// for global use of typescript
// typescript file to js file : tsc intro.ts  (converts ts file to js file )
